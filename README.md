# Configuration files for synthetic monitoring tests

Setup tests that runs every X hour. The tests will automatically be picked up on the next iteration. You can add tests that will run on WebPageTest/Browsertime/sitespeed.io and use WebPageReplay as a replay proxy. In the future you can also add tests to run on physical phones.

Work in progress :)

## Add a new URL to test

## Add a new user scenario to test

## Where do I find the data/metrics?
